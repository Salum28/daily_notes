# Daily Notes App

The following project was made in a Flutter course i made, and the main goals of this app were:

* Learn how to store, read, update and delete data using SQFLITE;
* Learn how to work with dynamic texts in apps;
    * In this app, the update and create note button text changes dynamically depending on the user's action;
* Learn how to work with Maps in a class;
* Learn how to work with Models and Helpers in Apps;

Also, one of the app's goals was to pratice layout creation and customization.
## How the App Works

When you inicialize the app, you will see a floating action button, when you click in it, a Alert Dialog will show with two text fields in it, one for the note title, and other to the note description, so you can write your note, and you will see two buttons, one to cancel the action and close the dialog, and other to save or update the note.

When you save the note, a table containing the notes that you saved will be created and saved in a SQL Sheet, and the tasks that you saved will be shown in your screen.

To update the note, click in the update button, when yo do that, a alert dialog will appear with the note data writen in the text fields, just update what you want and click in the update button to confirm your action or click in the cancel button to close the dialog and keep the note as it was before.

To delete a note just click in the delete button.
